% inputs:   
%           fname: path variable to .TIF stack containing sample phantom
%
%           (Optional inputs)
%           rows:       1D array of row indices to accept within overall 
%                       .TIF 3D phantom
%           cols:       1D array of col indices to accept within overall 
%                       .TIF 3D phantom
%           idx:        1D array of z-indices to accept within overall .TIF
%                       3D phantom
%
% outputs:
%           obj:        3D object from .TIF stack, scaled to be between 
%                       n_media and n_max
